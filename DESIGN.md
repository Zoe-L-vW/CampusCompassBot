# Project Design Document: Campus Compass

This document outlines the design, key features, and development plan for the "Campus Compass" project.

## Project Overview

The "Campus Compass" is a web application designed to simplify the transition for new international and national students arriving in Hildesheim, Germany. It will serve as a hybrid tool, offering both a pre-populated, comprehensive guide to essential university and city-related tasks, and a personal to-do list where students can manage their own unique tasks.

**Our Goal:** To empower new students to confidently navigate their initial challenges in Hildesheim, fostering a sense of belonging and ensuring they can fully embrace the "land of plenty" that Hildesheim offers. The platform aims for **information dissipation** in both **German and English**.
