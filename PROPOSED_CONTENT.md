### Personalized Survey Introduction Text

This is the text designed to introduce your Google Form survey, including your personal details:

Hello there!

I'm **Aaditya Chaturvedi**, and I'm currently in my first semester of **MSc. Data Analytics** here at Hildesheim. You can usually find me in the Mensa, but you can also just call me **Adi** for short!

Just like you, I chose Hildesheim as my academic home. As an international student myself, I've navigated the exhilarating, yet at times, incredibly challenging journey of settling into a new country, a new city, and a new university. I've faced the frustrations, the moments of loneliness, and the feeling of being overwhelmed.

But through it all, I've also discovered the **magic of Hildesheim**. This truly is a "land of plenty" – brimming with hidden opportunities, supportive communities, and a vibrant student life waiting to be explored. The key, I've learned, is knowing **how** to unlock it all.

That's why **I'm starting a movement to share wisdom**. I believe that no student should have to navigate these waters alone, making the same mistakes or missing out on the incredible experiences Hildesheim offers.

I'm asking for just **5 minutes** of your valuable time. Share your personal hacks, your hard-earned lessons, and those "aha!" moments that made your student life better. Whether it's a clever way to save money, a trick for navigating bureaucracy, a secret study spot, or the best way to meet new friends – your insights are the building blocks of something truly special: **a student handbook, built by us, for us, on how to truly live and thrive in Hildesheim.**

This survey is **completely anonymous**. Your voice will be heard, your experiences will guide others, and together, we can make Hildesheim an even more welcoming and rewarding place for every student who calls it home.

Will you join me in building this legacy of support?
